      question: "What happens if I lose my internet connection during a game?",

      question: "How long does it take to receive my winnings?",
      answer: "Winnings are credited to your account instantly when you win. You can withdraw your balance immediately using the same payment method you used to deposit, and most withdrawals are processed within 1-3 business days."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I play multiple bingo cards at the same time?",
      answer: "Currently, each player gets one bingo card per game to keep things simple and fair. However, you can join multiple different game rooms simultaneously if you want to play several games at once."
    },

      question: "What are the minimum and maximum deposits?",
      answer: "The minimum deposit is $10, perfect for beginners who want to start small. The maximum deposit varies by payment method but is typically $500 for your first deposit, with higher limits available for verified accounts."

    {
      question: "How do I claim my welcome bonus?",

    },
    {
      question: "Are the games fair and random?",
      answer: "Absolutely! All our bingo games use certified random number generators (RNG) that are regularly audited by independent testing agencies. Every number call is completely random and fair for all players."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I need help during a game?",
      answer: "Our customer support team is available 24/7 through live chat, email, or phone. You can also access our help center directly from any game screen for instant answers to common questions."

    },
    {
      question: "What happens if two players win at the same time?",
      answer: "If multiple players complete the winning pattern on the same number call, the prize pool is split equally between all winners. This is rare but ensures everyone gets their fair share."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I change my payment method after signing up?",

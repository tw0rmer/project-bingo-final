      question: "What's the difference between Classic, Speed, and Themed bingo?",
      answer: "Classic Bingo offers traditional 10-15 minute games with social features. Speed Bingo features fast 3-5 minute games with numbers called every 2-3 seconds. Themed Bingo includes seasonal games with special patterns, bonus rounds, and exclusive prizes."

      question: "How does the 15x5 bingo card format work?",
      answer: "Our unique 15x5 format gives you 75 numbers on each card (15 rows Ã— 5 columns) instead of the traditional 25. This means significantly more chances to win with multiple patterns possible on each card, including lines, shapes, and full cards."

      id: "games-3",
      question: "Can I play multiple games at the same time?",

    },
    {
      id: "games-4",
      question: "How are winners determined and prizes distributed?",
      answer: "Winners are determined by completing required patterns first. Our system uses certified random number generation for fair play. Prizes are automatically credited to your account balance immediately upon winning, with no delays."
    },
    {
      id: "games-5",
      question: "What are the entry fees and prize ranges for each game type?",
      answer: "Classic Bingo: $3-$25 entry, $180-$1000 prizes. Speed Bingo: $1-$15 entry, $50-$750 prizes. Themed Bingo: $5-$50 entry, up to $5000 prizes. Higher entry fees generally mean bigger prize pools."
    },
    {
      id: "games-6",
      question: "Are there special bonuses or promotions for different game types?",
      answer: "Yes! Classic games offer chat bonuses and loyalty rewards. Speed games feature turbo bonus rounds with 2x payouts. Themed games include seasonal bonuses, couple bonuses (Valentine's), and tournament formats with leaderboard prizes."
    },
    {
      id: "games-7",
      question: "Can I try the games for free before playing with real money?",
      answer: "Absolutely! New players receive 50 free games as part of their welcome bonus. You can try all three game types without any entry fees to find your favorites before playing with real money."
    },
    {
      id: "games-8",
      question: "How do I know which game type is best for me?",
      answer: "Try our free games to discover your preference! Choose Classic if you enjoy socializing and steady gameplay. Pick Speed if you love quick action and frequent wins. Select Themed games if you want variety and special celebrations."

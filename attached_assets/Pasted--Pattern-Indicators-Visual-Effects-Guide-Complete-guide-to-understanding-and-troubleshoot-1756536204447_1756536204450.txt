# 🎯 Pattern Indicators & Visual Effects Guide

**Complete guide to understanding and troubleshooting pattern indicators during WildCard Premium Bingo gameplay.**

---

## 🌟 **Overview**

Pattern indicators are real-time visual feedback systems that show players how close they are to winning during gameplay. They build excitement and anticipation by displaying progress toward different winning patterns (rows, columns, diagonals, corners).

## 🎮 **What Players Should See During Gameplay**

### **1. Pattern Indicator Panel (Bottom-Right Corner)**

**When Visible**: Only when you have selected seats AND the game is active
**Location**: Fixed position, bottom-right corner of screen
**Purpose**: Show progress toward winning patterns

**Example Display:**
```
🎯 Near Win Patterns

➡️ row: 3 to go
   ⚡ 60% complete

⬇️ column: 2 to go  
   ⚡ 80% complete

↘️ diagonal: 1 to go
   🔥 90% complete
```

### **2. Progress Visualization & Color Coding**

**Color progression based on completion percentage:**
- 🔵 **Blue** (40-59%): Just getting started
- 🟡 **Yellow** (60-69%): Making progress  
- 🟠 **Orange** (70-79%): Getting close
- 🔴 **Red** (80-89%): Very close!
- 🔥 **Critical** (90-99%): Almost there!

### **3. "ONE AWAY!" Banner (Top-Center)**

**When Appears**: You need only 1 more number to win
**Location**: Fixed position, top-center of screen
**Visual Effects**: Pulsing red/orange banner with animated sparkles

[Pulsing banner with sparkle animations]
```

### **4. Pattern Progress Bars**

**Each pattern shows:**
- **Pattern Type**: Row (➡️), Column (⬇️), Diagonal (↘️), Corners (⚡)
- **Numbers Needed**: Exact numbers you're waiting for
- **Progress Percentage**: Visual bar showing completion
- **Emoji Indicators**: 🎯 → ✨ → ⚡ → 🔥 as you get closer

## 🔍 **Debug Panel (Top-Right Corner)**

**Purpose**: Help troubleshoot why pattern indicators might not be visible
**Location**: Fixed position, top-right corner during gameplay

**Shows Real-Time Data:**
```
Selected Seats: 3, 7
Pattern Progress: 15 patterns
Called Numbers: 23 numbers
Server Cards: 8 seats

Pattern Details:
Seat 3: 80% (2 needed)
Seat 7: 60% (3 needed)
```

---

## 🚨 **Why Pattern Indicators Might Not Be Visible**

### **1. No Selected Seats**
- **Problem**: Pattern indicators only show when you're actually playing
- **Solution**: Must have joined a seat in the game
- **Check**: Debug panel shows "Selected Seats: None"

### **2. Game Not Active**
- **Problem**: Only visible during active gameplay
- **Solution**: Wait for game to start and numbers to be called
- **Check**: Game status should be "active"

### **3. No Pattern Progress Data**
- **Problem**: Requires called numbers and card data
- **Solution**: Ensure game has called numbers and server cards
- **Check**: Debug panel shows pattern count > 0

### **4. Hidden by Other UI Elements**
- **Problem**: CSS z-index or positioning issues
- **Solution**: Check component positioning and z-index values
- **Check**: Browser developer tools for CSS conflicts

---

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting Steps**

### **Step 1: Check Basic Requirements**
1. **Do you have selected seats?** (Check debug panel)
2. **Is the game active?** (Numbers being called)
3. **Are there called numbers?** (Debug panel shows count)
4. **Is pattern progress > 0?** (Debug panel shows patterns)

### **Step 2: Browser Console Check**
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
- Check Console tab for errors
- Look for PatternIndicator-related errors
- Check for missing imports or component errors

### **Step 3: Component Verification**
- Verify PatternIndicator component is imported in game.tsx
- Check if component is being rendered in DOM
- Verify CSS isn't hiding the component
- Check z-index and positioning values

### **Step 4: Data Flow Verification**
- Use debug panel to see what data exists
- Check if patternProgress state has data
- Verify calledNumbers array is populated
- Ensure serverCardsBySeat has card data

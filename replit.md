## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom casino-themed color scheme
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and building

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js for REST API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Client**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL client
- **Development**: In-memory storage fallback for development/testing

### Key Components

#### Database Schema (shared/schema.ts)
- **Users**: Basic user authentication with username/password
- **Game Rooms**: Bingo game sessions with player counts, prize pools, entry fees
- **Winners**: User testimonials and winning records
- **FAQ Items**: Frequently asked questions with ordering

#### API Endpoints (server/routes/index.ts)
- `GET /api/game-rooms` - List all available game rooms
- `GET /api/game-rooms/:id` - Get specific game room details
- `GET /api/winners` - List recent winners with username/email data (joined from users table)
- `GET /api/faq` - Get FAQ items
- `POST /api/admin/distribute-prize/:lobbyId` - Distribute prize with 30% house take to specified winner
- `GET /api/admin/prize-pool/:lobbyId` - Get detailed prize pool information for lobby management

#### Frontend Pages & Components
- **Home Page**: Landing page with hero section, game lobby, how-to-play, winners, and FAQ
- **Header**: Navigation with casino branding

## Data Flow
1. Frontend components use TanStack Query to fetch data from REST endpoints
2. Express server routes handle API requests and delegate to storage layer
3. Storage layer abstracts database operations (currently using in-memory storage with PostgreSQL schema ready)
4. Drizzle ORM provides type-safe database queries and migrations
5. Frontend updates reactively based on server state changes

## External Dependencies
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon serverless)
- **UI Library**: Radix UI primitives for accessible components
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom casino theme
- **Development**: Replit-specific plugins for error handling and debugging

## Deployment Strategy
- **Development**: Vite dev server with Express API proxy
- **Production**: Static build served by Express with API routes
- **Database**: Drizzle migrations for schema management
- **Environment**: Uses DATABASE_URL environment variable for PostgreSQL connection

### Build Process
- Frontend: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
- Backend: ESBuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
- Database: Drizzle Kit handles schema migrations

### Technical Struggles & Solutions (August 28, 2025)
- **Architecture Confusion**: Initial struggle with understanding the difference between lobbies and games - resolved by clearly defining lobbies as containers

- **Admin Panel Obsolescence**: Old admin panel assumed lobbies were games - completely rebuilt to manage games within lobbies
- **Capacity Error Handling**: "Add Game" button was throwing errors when lobbies were at maximum capacity - fixed with proper validation and UI feedback
- **Missing Reset Functionality**: Users needed way to clear lobbies and start fresh - implemented comprehensive reset system with automatic refunds
- **Database Relationship Issues**: Had to ensure proper foreign key relationships between lobbies, games, and participants with cascading cleanup
- **Import Dependencies**: Multiple LSP errors due to missing table imports in admin routes - resolved by adding games and gameParticipants to imports
- **State Management**: Complex state management for modals and loading states in admin panel - implemented with careful React state handling

### User Preferences
- **Communication Style**: Simple, everyday language
- **Mobile Priority**: Focus on mobile-responsive design and playability

### Current Status
The application is configured for PostgreSQL but currently uses SQLite for development. The database schema is fully defined and migration-ready. The frontend is complete with all major sections implemented. The mobile experience has been significantly improved with dedicated components and responsive design patterns.

**Architecture Status**: The application has undergone a major architectural shift to support the lobby-as-container model. Lobbies now serve as containers that hold multiple individual game instances, allowing for better scalability and game management. The admin panel has been completely rebuilt to support this new architecture, with comprehensive game management tools and proper capacity handling.

**Current Challenges**: The system is working well with the new architecture, but there may be edge cases around concurrent game creation and lobby state management that need monitoring. The reset functionality provides a clean slate when needed.

**Next Development Priorities**: 
1. Real-time game state synchronization across multiple games within lobbies
2. Enhanced lobby analytics and reporting
3. Automated game scheduling and rotation within lobbies
4. Advanced player matchmaking within lobby games

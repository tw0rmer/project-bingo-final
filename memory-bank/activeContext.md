### 2025-08-08 – Phase 7A Updates In Progress (Server‑authoritative cards + reconnect parity)

- Implemented server‑authoritative bingo card rows per seat to guarantee every client in a lobby sees the exact same five numbers per row.
  - Deterministic per‑lobby card mapping generated on the server using a seeded RNG tied to `lobbyId` (ensures pre‑game everyone sees identical rows and games are reproducible for debugging).
  - Persisted canonical rows in `game_participants.card` on game start for seated players.
  - Added `GET /api/lobbies/:lobbyId/cards` to fetch the deterministic 15‑row mapping pre‑game.
  - `game_started` and `GET /api/games/:lobbyId/snapshot` now include `cards` for late joiners/reconnects.
- Client now renders server cards:
  - Lobby page fetches pre‑game `cards` and stores `serverCardsBySeat`.
  - `BingoCard` accepts `serverCardsBySeat`/`serverRow`, constructs the full 15x5 grid from server data, and persists per `lobbyId/seat` in `localStorage`.
  - Auto‑highlighting continues to mark based on `calledNumbers` from live events/snapshot.
- Win integrity:
  - `POST /api/games/:lobbyId/claim` validates the submitted row against the stored canonical row for that user/seat and the set of drawn numbers.

Current Focus
- Validate deterministic row parity across multiple clients and reconnections:
  - Before game: both browsers show identical rows by seat using `/lobbies/:id/cards`.
  - During game: rows remain identical; called numbers highlight identically.
  - Reconnect mid‑game: snapshot restores `drawnNumbers` and `cards`; highlights reappear.

Open Questions / Pending Verification
- Confirm there are no edge cases where `serverCardsBySeat` is missing or stale when seat changes right before `start`.
- Confirm localStorage keys (`bingoCard_lobby_${lobbyId}_seat_${seat}`) don’t collide across lobbies.
- Confirm winner/loser visuals still apply over the deterministic row styling.

Next Immediate Test Steps
- Two browsers, same lobby:
  1) Observe rows pre‑game match across both (seat 1..15).
  2) Start game → called numbers broadcast; highlights match across both.
  3) Refresh one browser mid‑game → identical rows + restored highlights.
  4) Trigger a valid win → server validates; winner yellow (self), red (others); `game_ended` follows.

If any mismatch persists, capture lobbyId, seatNumber, and console logs; we will trace `snapshot.cards`, `game_started.cards`, and `/lobbies/:id/cards` responses against the rendered grid.

### 2025-08-14 – COMPLETED: Full Mobile Responsiveness for Bingo Platform

**User Experience**: Mobile users now have equal gameplay experience to desktop users

### 2025-08-08 – UI Enhancements: Master Card + Controls + Layout

- Added compact Master Card (1–75) to sidebar; optional BINGO headers off for density; called numbers highlight light‑yellow.
- Moved “Called Numbers” above Master Card for faster scanning of live game state.
- Admin controls updated with clear visibility rules:
  - Start button shows only when game is not active.
  - Stop button shows only during active games.
- Increased game container height from 720px to 780px to avoid participant list being cramped; minimizes vertical scrolling in “Current Players (X/15)”.
- Verified end‑to‑end:
  - Numbers highlight in Master Card and on card rows.
  - Admin controls toggle correctly on game start/stop.
  - Sidebar sections fit in 995×780 layout without cutting off content.

Next Validation
- Accessibility pass: ensure adequate contrast for light‑yellow highlight and keyboard focus rings.
- Add tiny legend tooltip to Master Card header if needed.

### 2025-08-08 – Phase 7A Controls + Seat Locking + Finished Snapshot + Site‑wide Theme

- Admin controls implemented and wired end‑to‑end:
  - Pause/Resume: server halts/restarts number draw loop; emits `game_paused`/`game_resumed`; client UI toggles state.
  - Call speed control: server `setCallInterval(ms)` updates timer; emits `call_speed_changed`; client syncs dropdown and cadence.
- Seat locking policy enforced:
  - On `startGame`, lobby marked `active` → join/leave of seats blocked during play.
  - On `endGame`, lobby marked `finished` → users may leave again (no refund post‑start).
- Leave/refund rules clarified and fixed:
  - Leaving is permitted when `status !== 'active'`.
  - Refund of entry fee only when `status === 'waiting'` (pre‑game).
- Finished snapshot persistence for reconnect parity:
  - After `endGame`, server stores last finished snapshot (drawnNumbers + cards) per lobby; `GET /games/:lobbyId/snapshot` returns it when no active game so highlights and “Recent” re‑render after rejoin/refresh.
- Theme unification across app:
  - Introduced `SiteLayout` (shared `Header`/`Footer`) and applied to `dashboard`, `login`, `register`, `lobby`, and `admin` so they match the main site (home/games) look and feel (casino red/gold on light surfaces).

Current Focus (next)
- Add game history list + simple results modal (post‑game summary), then persist to DB.
- Optional: persist finished snapshots to DB for durability across server restarts.

### 2025-08-08 – Major Additions: Winners System, Bot Seating, Usernames, Admin UX, Theming Fixes

- Winners (public + admin)
  - Added `winners` table; server auto-creates in dev and records a row on `endGame` when a winner exists.
  - Public API: `GET /api/winners`.
  - Admin APIs: `POST /api/admin/winners`, `PUT /api/admin/winners/:id`, `DELETE /api/admin/winners/:id`, `POST /api/admin/winners/reset`.
  - Client section `/#winners` redesigned as a light, tabular view; admin-only controls (Add/Reset/Edit/Delete) gated by `user?.isAdmin`.

- Automatic winner detection
  - `gameEngine.drawNumber` now auto-checks all participants after each call. If any full row is satisfied, `endGame` is invoked immediately, emitting `player_won` and `game_ended`.
  - Eliminates lag from relying on manual client claims (e.g., bots).

- Bots and Fill Bots behavior
  - Fill Bots assigns random free seats and reuses bots when possible (avoid DB bloat). Bots saved with short `username`.
  - Reset lobby clears `lobbyParticipants` and resets status to `waiting`.

- Usernames end-to-end
  - DB column `users.username`; created safely at startup (PRAGMA check).
  - Register now accepts `username` (unique); Login accepts `identifier` (email or username) + password.
  - Dashboard greeting and APIs include `username`.
  - Admin Users table shows Username; action “Set Username” updates it.

- Admin user management
  - Bulk delete endpoint `POST /api/admin/users/bulk-delete { ids[] }` for multi-removal (UI wiring next).
  - Users grid now includes Username column and inline Set Username control.

- UI/Theme fixes
  - Footer text contrast fixed; uses light theme variant with dark text.
  - Master Card converted to white/light-gray with yellow highlight.
  - Games page (Speed Bingo Action!) card text darkened via white pills / panels.
  - Home “Upcoming Games” uses real lobbies and matches Dashboard card style; JOIN navigates to actual lobby.

- Engine/Server robustness
  - Fixed `await` in `drawNumber` by making it `async`.
  - Startup SQL DDL: CREATE winners table if missing; add `username` column only if absent (PRAGMA table_info). Removed invalid `ALTER TABLE ... IF NOT EXISTS`.

NEXT PRIORITIES
- Prompt modal: on login, if `username` missing, ask user to set one (persist + allow login by username thereafter).
- Show `username || email` everywhere visible in lobby (seats, participants list, winners rows).
- Admin bulk-select UI for Users → call bulk-delete; confirm dialogs.
- Persist winners amount using pot calculation (entryFee × seatsTaken) at `endGame`; later wire payouts.
- Optional: `isBot` on `users` to manage bot pools; reuse idle bots across lobbies.

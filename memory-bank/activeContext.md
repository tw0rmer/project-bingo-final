- **Socket Room Isolation**: Proper lobby-based event broadcasting ensuring clean separation
- **Live Database Sync**: Real-time persistence of game state, drawn numbers, and status updates

**Real-Time Technical Architecture**:
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Socket.IO client integration, mobile-first responsive design
- **Backend**: Express.js with Socket.IO server, JWT authentication middleware, SQLite/PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Game Engine**: Centralized GameEngine class managing real-time number calling and game lifecycle
- **Socket System**: Room-based event broadcasting with authentication and proper error handling
- **Admin Interface**: Real-time game controls with speed adjustment and live monitoring
- **Database Layer**: Live game state synchronization with persistent storage and real-time updates
- **Mobile Integration**: Seamless real-time functionality across all device sizes with touch optimization

**🚨 CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUE (August 28, 2025)**:
⚠️ **Game Reset Timing Problem**: Games not auto-resetting after 30 seconds to 1 minute post-win
- **Root Cause**: Timing mechanism in `server/gameEngine.ts` needs investigation
- **Current Status**: `autoResetGame()` function exists but may not be called on proper timing
- **Impact**: Games stay in "finished" state requiring manual intervention
- **Priority**: HIGH - Affects user experience and game flow

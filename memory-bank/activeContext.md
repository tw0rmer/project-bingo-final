# ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-29 05:25:00  
**Session**: Emergency Production Fixes + Live Seat Update Resolution  
**Status**: 🚀 **MAJOR PROGRESS - Live Seat Updates Fixed!**

## 🎯 **PRIMARY GOALS**

### ✅ **COMPLETED & TESTED**:
1. **🆕 LIVE SEAT UPDATES** - **FIXED & CONFIRMED WORKING!** Resolved duplicate endpoint conflict

### 🔧 **CODE APPLIED - AWAITING TESTING**:
1. **Prize Pool Distribution** - Enhanced error handling and achievement integration
2. **Admin Speed Control** - Fixed "No active game" error with delayed cleanup
3. **Game Auto-Reset** - Fixed lobby status not resetting to "active"
4. **Mobile Winner Modal** - Improved responsiveness and overflow handling
5. **Achievement System** - Corrected import path errors
6. **Visual Winner Prediction** - Added glowing effects and number indicators

### 🔄 **ONGOING INVESTIGATION**:
- **Game Reset Timing** - Games not auto-resetting after 30-60 seconds post-win

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES STATUS**

| Issue | Status | Priority | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Live Seat Selection** | ✅ **FIXED & TESTED** | CRITICAL | **Duplicate endpoint conflict resolved!** |
| Prize Pool Distribution | 🔧 **CODE APPLIED** | CRITICAL | Enhanced error handling + achievements |
| Admin Speed Control | 🔧 **CODE APPLIED** | CRITICAL | Delayed cleanup + extensive debugging |
| User Profile Achievements | 🔧 **CODE APPLIED** | HIGH | Import path corrected |
| Pattern Probability Visuals | 🔧 **CODE APPLIED** | MEDIUM | Glowing effects + number indicators |
| Game Auto-Reset Timing | 🔍 **INVESTIGATING** | HIGH | 30-60 second delay mechanism |

## 🎮 **LIVE SEAT UPDATE SUCCESS**

### **Root Cause Identified**:
- **Duplicate join endpoints** in `server/routes/games.ts`
- First endpoint (no socket events) was overriding second endpoint (with socket events)
- Socket events were never emitted

### **Fix Applied**:
- Removed duplicate endpoint without socket functionality
- Kept socket-enabled endpoint with enhanced debugging
- Real-time seat updates now working across all browsers

### **✅ Confirmed Working**:
- Immediate seat updates without page refresh
- Real-time participant count changes
- Instant visual feedback when seats are taken/freed

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Files Modified Today**:
- `server/gameEngine.ts` - Prize distribution, admin speed control, achievements
- `server/routes/games.ts` - **Live seat updates fixed**
- `client/src/components/games/bingo-card.tsx` - Visual winner prediction
- `client/src/components/games/winner-celebration-modal.tsx` - Mobile responsiveness

### **Key Fixes Applied**:
1. **Live Seat Updates**: **Resolved duplicate endpoint conflict** ✅ **TESTED**
2. **Prize Distribution**: Enhanced error handling + achievement integration 🔧 **NEEDS TESTING**
3. **Admin Speed Control**: Delayed `lobbyToGameId` cleanup (30 seconds) 🔧 **NEEDS TESTING**
4. **Game Auto-Reset**: Ensured lobby status resets to "active" 🔧 **NEEDS TESTING**
5. **Visual Effects**: Added glowing indicators for close-to-win rows 🔧 **NEEDS TESTING**

## 📈 **PROJECT STATUS**

### **Overall Progress**: **90% Operational**
- **Core Game Engine**: ✅ Fully functional
- **Real-time Features**: ✅ **Live seat updates working!**
- **Admin Controls**: 🔧 **Code fixed - needs testing**
- **User Experience**: 🔧 **Code enhanced - needs testing**
- **Game Lifecycle**: 🔍 Auto-reset timing investigation needed

### **Next Priority**:
- **Test admin speed control** during live games
- **Test pattern visuals** during gameplay
- **Investigate game auto-reset timing** in `server/gameEngine.ts`

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

1. **✅ Test live seat updates** across multiple browsers - **COMPLETED**
2. **🧪 Test admin speed control** during live games
3. **🧪 Test pattern visuals** during gameplay
4. **Investigate game auto-reset timing** in `server/gameEngine.ts`
5. **Verify all fixes** work together in production environment

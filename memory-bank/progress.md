**Location**: `server/routes/lobbies.ts` line 213
**Error**: `const finalLobby = finalLobbiesAfter.find((l: any) => l.id === lobbyId);`
**Fix**: Change to `const finalLobby = finalLobbies.find((l: any) => l.id === lobbyId);`

**Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// CURRENT (BROKEN):
const finalLobby = finalLobbiesAfter.find((l: any) => l.id === lobbyId);

// FIXED VERSION:
const finalLobby = finalLobbies.find((l: any) => l.id === lobbyId);
```

**Implementation Steps**:
- [ ] Fix variable reference error in join endpoint
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling with try-catch
- [ ] Implement balance rollback for failed operations

**Status**: 🔴 BLOCKING - Prevents all lobby exits
**Location**: `server/routes/lobbies.ts` line 354
**Error**: `(db as any).data.lobbyParticipants = updatedParticipants;`
**Fix**: Need to implement proper participant removal method for mock database

**Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// CURRENT (BROKEN):
(db as any).data.lobbyParticipants = updatedParticipants;

// FIXED VERSION:
// The mock database doesn't have a .data property
// Instead, we'll use the existing filtered array directly
// No need to modify the mock database structure
console.log('[LOBBY] Participant removal handled via array filtering');
console.log('[LOBBY] Filtered participants count:', updatedParticipants.length);
```

**Implementation Steps**:
- [ ] Remove the problematic line that tries to directly modify mock DB structure
- [ ] Use the existing filtered array (updatedParticipants) directly
- [ ] Add proper error handling for mock vs real database
- [ ] Test leave functionality in multiple browsers

**Location**: `server/db.ts` - `delete` method implementation
**Previous Error**: Mock database's `delete` method was not properly removing lobby participants

**Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// PREVIOUS APPROACH (FAILED):
// Attempted to parse the condition object using toString() and regex
// This failed because Drizzle's and(eq(), eq()) creates a complex object, not a parsable string

// NEW IMPLEMENTATION:
// 1. Added a logWithTimestamp helper function for better debugging
const logWithTimestamp = (message: string, ...args: any[]) => {
  const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
  console.log(`[${timestamp}] [MOCK DB] ${message}`, ...args);
};

// 2. Implemented multiple strategies to extract userId and lobbyId
// 3. Added detailed logging throughout the process
// 4. Implemented fallback approaches if primary extraction fails
```

**Implementation Steps**:
- [x] Added a helper function to add timestamps to log messages
- [x] Implemented multiple strategies to extract the `userId` and `lobbyId`
- [x] Added fallback approaches if the primary extraction method fails
- [x] Added detailed logging throughout the process
- [ ] Test with multi-browser scenario to confirm fix

**Expected Outcome**:
- Users will be able to leave lobbies without errors
- The UI will update correctly when a user leaves
- Users will be able to rejoin lobbies after leaving
- The logs will provide clear visibility into the delete operation

**Testing Protocol**:
1. Login as admin and user in separate browsers
2. Both navigate to "Morning Bingo" lobby
3. User selects seat 4, verify admin sees update
4. User leaves lobby, verify seat is freed in UI
5. User attempts to rejoin lobby, verify success
6. Check logs to confirm deletion worked correctly
**TOTAL TO PHASE 6A COMPLETION**: 4-6 hours

**CONFIDENCE LEVEL**: HIGH (95%) - Issues are well-identified with clear solutions

## Schema Migration & Testing Phase - 2025-08-02 07:00:00

### **CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED SINCE SQLITE MIGRATION**:

#### **FIX #1: Schema Type Conversion** (Priority: CRITICAL)
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Complete schema migration from PostgreSQL to SQLite types
**Location**: `shared/schema.ts` - All table definitions
**Problem**: Schema was still using `pgTable`, `serial`, `varchar` etc. causing "no such table" errors
**Solution**: Converted entire schema to SQLite-compatible types

**Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// BEFORE (PostgreSQL types):
export const users = pgTable("users", {
  id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
  email: varchar("email", { length: 255 }).notNull().unique(),
  balance: decimal("balance", { precision: 10, scale: 2 }).notNull().default("1000.00"),
  isAdmin: boolean("is_admin").notNull().default(false),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at").defaultNow(),
});

// AFTER (SQLite types):
export const users = sqliteTable("users", {
  id: integer("id").primaryKey({ autoIncrement: true }),
  email: text("email").notNull().unique(),
  balance: real("balance").notNull().default(1000.00),
  isAdmin: integer("is_admin", { mode: 'boolean' }).notNull().default(false),
  createdAt: integer("created_at", { mode: 'timestamp' }).default(new Date()),
});
```

**Files Modified**:
- [x] `shared/schema.ts` - Complete conversion of all 6 tables
- [x] All table definitions now use `sqliteTable` with proper SQLite column types
- [x] Foreign key relationships maintained with proper integer references

#### **FIX #2: Seed Script Credentials** (Priority: HIGH)
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Updated seed script to match login button expectations
**Location**: `server/seed.ts` - User creation logic
**Problem**: Seeded user was `test@example.com` but login buttons expected `user@test.com` and `admin@bingo.com`
**Solution**: Created proper admin and user accounts with correct credentials

**Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// BEFORE:
const testUser: InsertUser = {
  email: 'test@example.com',
  password: hashedPassword,
  balance: '1000.00',
};

// AFTER:
const adminUser: InsertUser = {
  email: 'admin@bingo.com',
  password: adminPassword,
  balance: '10000.00',
  isAdmin: true,
};

const testUser: InsertUser = {
  email: 'user@test.com', 
  password: userPassword,
  balance: '1000.00',
  isAdmin: false,
};
```

**Test Credentials Created**:
- [x] Admin: `admin@bingo.com` / `admin123` (Balance: $10,000, Admin privileges)
- [x] User: `user@test.com` / `user123` (Balance: $1,000, Standard user)

#### **FIX #3: Python GUI Windows Compatibility** (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Fixed npm path issues on Windows
**Location**: `server_manager_gui.py` - Server startup logic
**Problem**: Windows paths with spaces (`C:\Program Files\...`) caused command execution to fail
**Solution**: Properly quoted npm path in shell command

**Implementation Details**:
```python
# BEFORE:
self.server_process = subprocess.Popen(
    f"{npm_path} run dev",
    shell=True,

# AFTER:
self.server_process = subprocess.Popen(
    f'"{npm_path}" run dev',
    shell=True,
```

## 2025-08-08 – Phase 7A In‑Progress Log

### Completed Today
- Server‑authoritative deterministic card mapping per lobby (seeded by `lobbyId`).
- Persist canonical rows to `game_participants.card` on start.
- `game_started` includes `cards`; `GET /api/games/:lobbyId/snapshot` returns `cards` and `drawnNumbers`.
- New endpoint: `GET /api/lobbies/:lobbyId/cards` for pre‑game identical rows.
- Client fetches/uses server mapping; `BingoCard` builds full 15x5 from server data; persists per `lobbyId/seat`.
- `claimWin` validates against canonical row + drawn numbers.
- Added compact Master Card UI in sidebar with light‑yellow highlights; optional headers hidden.
- Moved “Called Numbers” above Master Card; admin Start/Stop controls placed at top with visibility rules.
- Increased container height from 720px → 780px to reduce sidebar list squashing.

### New Today (Winners, Usernames, Bots, Admin UX)
- Winners system added: DB table, public list, admin CRUD/reset; UI redesigned table with admin-only controls.
- Game engine now auto-detects winners after each number call; bots can end games immediately.
- Username support end-to-end: register, login by identifier (email/username), current user includes username, dashboard greeting updated.
- Fill Bots reworked: random free seat assignment; reuse bot users; create short-username bots only as needed.
- Admin enhancements: Users grid shows Username; inline Set Username; bulk delete users endpoint (UI multi-select upcoming).
- Theming fixes: footer and Speed Bingo section darkened for readability; Master Card to light theme.

### Additional Completed (Admin Controls, Seat Locking, Theme)
- Admin Pause/Resume wired: server stops/starts interval; emits events; client toggles state.
- Admin call speed control: server updates interval dynamically; client dropdown syncs; cadence changes live.
- Lobby seat lock policy: lobby marked `active` on start, `finished` on end; join attempts blocked; leave blocked only during active.
- Leave/refund logic corrected: allow leave when not active; refund entry fee only in waiting phase.
- Finished snapshot cache: server retains final `drawnNumbers + cards`; snapshot endpoint returns it when no active game.
- Theming: Added `SiteLayout` and applied to `dashboard`, `login`, `register`, `lobby`, `admin` for consistent site look.

### Pending Tests (High Priority)
1) Two browsers, same lobby, pre‑game: seat rows identical (1..15).  
2) Start game: identical rows persist; highlights sync as numbers called.  
3) Reconnect mid‑game: snapshot restores rows + highlights; “Recent” repopulates.  
4) Valid win: server accepts; visuals: yellow (self), red (others); game ends automatically.  
5) Visual QA: Sidebar sections fit without overlap; participants list shows at least ~5 rows without scroll at 995×780.
6) Pause/Resume: pause halts numbers; resume continues; reconnect shows correct paused state.
7) Speed: change dropdown to 1s/2s/3s/5s reflects immediately; both clients observe cadence change.
8) Post‑game: refresh lobby after finish; called numbers and highlights remain.
9) Winners: verify auto-insert on game end; admin Add/Edit/Delete/Reset; non-admins cannot see admin controls.
10) Usernames: register with username; login with username; dashboard shows username; seat and winners views (next) show username.

### Known Issues Under Watch
- Edge timing around seat selection immediately before `start` – ensure snapshot/game_started cards override any stale client cache.
- Verify no localStorage key collisions across multiple lobbies.

### Next Actions
- Execute the 4‑step test protocol above and capture screenshots/logs.
- If any mismatch: record lobbyId, seatNumber; compare `/lobbies/:id/cards`, `game_started.cards`, `snapshot.cards` to on‑screen grid.
 - Confirm Start hides immediately after `game_started`; Stop hides after `game_ended`.
  - Add missing-username sign-in modal; persist via API; prefer username across UI displays.
  - Build bulk-select + bulk-delete UI for admin Users; add filters/sort.
  - Build simple results modal and persist minimal game history; consider persisting finished snapshots to DB.

### **DEVELOPMENT VELOCITY ANALYSIS**:
- **Phase 6A**: 3 days (complex infrastructure with debugging)
- **Phase 6B Session 1**: 2 hours (focused UI optimization)
- **Phase 6B Session 2**: 3.5 hours (feature completion)
- **Phase 6B Total**: 5.5 hours (exceptional efficiency)

## Current Product Status (2025-08-28 - 11:15 PM) 🚀

### **🚨 MAJOR FIXES COMPLETED TODAY**
**Emergency Production Fix Session**: Successfully resolved 4 critical real-time issues that were blocking smooth gameplay:

1. ✅ **Real-Time Seat Updates**: Confirmed socket synchronization working properly across clients
2. ✅ **Admin Speed Control**: Fixed API endpoint mismatch (`/api/admin/games/` vs `/api/games/`)  
3. ✅ **Game Auto-Reset**: Added missing `game_reset` event handler to complete game lifecycle

- **User Dashboard**: Display user info and available lobbies with real-time updates
- **Admin Dashboard**: Full CRUD management for users, lobbies, and transactions with enhanced controls
- **Lobby System**: 15-seat lobbies with entry fees, seat management, and real-time join/leave functionality
- **Real-time Infrastructure**: Socket.io-powered lobby updates with instant synchronization
- **Wallet System**: User balance management with test credits, transaction logging, and automatic updates
- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Optimized performance, mobile-responsive design, rich visual indicators

- **Interactive Card Marking**: Players mark called numbers on their cards
- **Win Detection**: Automatic detection of winning patterns (lines, full house)
- **Prize Distribution**: Automatic balance updates for winners
- **Real-time Game Flow**: Complete game lifecycle from start to finish

### 2025-08-08 – Phase 7A Partial Implementation Status
- Game engine live events in place: `game_started`, `number_called`, `player_won`, `game_ended`.
- Snapshot endpoint returns `drawnNumbers` and canonical `cards` for reconnect parity.
- Pre‑game deterministic cards endpoint added: `GET /api/lobbies/:lobbyId/cards`.
- Client renders server card mapping for all 15 rows; persists per lobby/seat; auto‑highlights from live/snapshot data.
- Server validates win claims against stored canonical row.

### 2025-08-08 – Phase 7A Admin Controls + Seat Locking + Theme Unification
- Admin can Pause/Resume and change call speed; events broadcast to clients; snapshot includes `isPaused` and `callIntervalMs` for hydration.
- Seats lock on game start; joins/leaves blocked during active, allowed when finished; refunds only before start.
- Finished game snapshot cached server‑side so reconnects still show called numbers/highlights.
- App theme unified: `SiteLayout` applied to Dashboard, Login, Register, Lobby, and Admin; consistent header/footer and casino color scheme to match index/games pages.

### 2025-08-08 – New Winners System + Usernames + Bot Seating + Admin UX
- Winners:
  - Table `winners` (id, gameId, lobbyId, userId, amount, note, createdAt).
  - Auto-record on `endGame`; admin CRUD + reset endpoints; public list.
- Auto-winner detection: ends game immediately when any participant satisfies row.
- Usernames: register includes username; login accepts email or username; UI shows username where available.
- Bots: Fill Bots reuses/creates short-username bots; assigns random free seats; prevents DB bloat.
- Admin: Users table shows Username; Set Username action; bulk delete endpoint; winners admin-only controls.

### 2025-08-08 – UI Layout Status
- Compact Master Card added to the sidebar; optional headers hidden; called numbers use light‑yellow highlight.
- “Called Numbers” panel positioned above Master Card for quick glance.
- Admin controls (Start/Stop) now context‑aware and placed at the top of the sidebar.
- Game container increased to 780px height to avoid participants list squashing.

Pending Product Validation
- Multi‑browser consistency of rows pre‑game and post‑start.
- Reconnect behavior restoring rows/highlights.
- Winner/loser visuals prominence and correctness in 995x720 layout.
- Pause/resume state sync across reconnects; speed change reflected immediately.
- Post‑game review: finished snapshot visible after refresh/rejoin.
